Sprint 3 Review

=================================================================================================================================================

Note: This review is reflective of the exact date the review was done.  Changes may have occurred in the intervening time since.

Note: I haven't run this through a spell-checker.  There are probably spelling mistakes.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

Trello Board Activity:

-People seem to be logging their hours on a regular basis for each card.

-Tasks are labeled according to categories.

-Nate Gamble seems to be the Trello dungeon master in charge of keeping Trello organized and up-to-date.

-Still tidy and neat.

-Basically everything I said last sprint review, left as is.

-Some imbalance in user hours logged, nate gamble and jae young choi seem to be speeding ahead of others.

-There appears to be a duplicate user for kelly oh (two of the same person).

-Is the "card" user keeping track of total hours logged for the entire team?

-Not sure as to the purpose of the "board" user.

-There seems to be 7 users total, going by non-duplicate names, and minus the two  users I mentioned above.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

User Stories:

-There are currently 9 user stories modeled in Trello.  This is a increase from the 3 I saw during the last sprint review.

-They seem to follow the 5 W's format and appear viable.

-Not all the user stories are implemented in the layout.xml of the Android Studio App Prototype I am reviewing.  For example, there is no way
to delete a user account yet, based on one of your user stories.  But this is a work in progress, so I assume you guys will implement them one-by-one.

-It will become plausible to implement account deletion and other functionalities once your back-end is up and operational.

-Otherwise, it looks like you have the basics covered for what the user should be able to do.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

Domain Model:

-The domain model is definitely still the pencil/pen and paper sketch I saw from last sprint that was previous on Trello.

-I suggest you update the domain model to reflect your current database schema.  This document needs to be updated.

-Not much else to say, as it hasn't changed since the last time.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

User Interface Model:

-The UI model is still the pencil/pen and paper sketch I saw from the last sprint?

-I suggest you update it to reflect the current state of your layout.xml files that I reviewed for your prototype.  This version in your GitHub
repo is definitely out-of-date/deprecated.

-One suggestion is to use screen captures of the different activites/fragments in your app prototype and add directional arrows indicating the
relationship of each screen to the other in the app.  This is what my team decided to do.

-Of course, it's hard to keep this model up to do date as changes are often continuous as development proceeds on a semi-regular basis.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

Supplemental technical requirements documentation:

-Please change the location of this document to the appropriate repository (refer to Miscellaneous section at the bottom of this review)

-It has improved from the rough draft I reviewed during the last sprint.

-Sounds pretty professional to me, at least.

-Succintly states the purpose of the application in the first and second paragraph, then lists the actual specifications below.

-It looks like you combined your vision statemetn and the actual technical requirements into one document.

-All specifications seem to be testable requirements.

-Looks good overall.

=================================================================================================================================================

GitHub data repository - Database Schema

-From what little I know of relational database, it looks like they have a working schema in place.

-The three relations, User, Passengers, and Ride, seems to cover the necessary information needed in order to schedule rides between users.

-I would suggest inserting more placeholder test values in each of the tables for when you begin implementing your back-end and testing that it
functions as intended.  Right now, you have entried inserted for Users but none for Ride or Passenger.

-I suggest you create a separate file for your query statements instead of including them along with your database schema.

-I suggest usecing "CASCADE" to drop tables so you don't need to worry about foreign constraints, etc.

-Otherwise, it looks good.

=================================================================================================================================================

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

GitHub client repository - Android App

-Prototype compiles, runs, and has placeholder functionality.

-Login screen is the launcher activity and provides a user name and password editTextView.

-Account creation activity provides editTextView for first name, last name, Calvin ID, user name, and password.

-I created an account and tried to login, but a toast message indicated my information was invalid.

-I attempted to create another account and login, same result.  Hence, I cannot see the rest of the app as I am blocked.

-Looking at the code-base, it is clean but lacks comments indicating what all the methods and classes are intended to do.

-I looked at the layout.xml files in order to get a better sense of what the app looks like.

-I recommend that in cativity_create_ride.xml you do not use yellow background and white text.  It probably won't read that well on a actual device.

-I recommend that in activity_user_profile.xml you do not use yellow background and whit etext.  It probably won't read that well on a actual device.

-From what I can tell, all the necessary screens to provide the full functionality of the app are in place.  Now, it's a matter of getting the 
back-end up and running and beginning integration.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

RESTful Web Service

-I see no indication it has been implemented, thus a review is not possible at this point in time.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

Design Presentation

-Overall, it was an effective presentation.  It easily generated enough interest to invite a entire sequence of questions from the audience.
(even if part of that is motivated by the graded aspect of event participation)

-I would say the delivery of the presentation fell around the mean value relative to the entire set of presentations for Teams A-H.

-The presentation slides themselves did their job, otherwise weren't particularly noteworthy in either a good or bad way.

-There wasn't anything that stood out to me as a spectacular success or a spectacular failure.

-As I'm finishing this section of the team review on Saturday, the finer details from Friday have sort of faded in memory.

-I noticed that on one of their slides they had "Domain Model - UI model" as the header while showing their UI model.  I was under the impression that those
two models are two very different kinds of models.

-Text and picture size could be larger on some slides, for ease of reading, especially for those sitting in the back rows.  Then again, I'm terribly
nearsighted with a lack of 20/20 vision wearing these 6+ year old pair of glasses, so individual mileage may vary.

-They effectively used their vision statement as their introductory speech for the presentation.  It provided a clear direction and idea behind
the app.

-Not particularly noteworthy, but there were consistent "Uhm's" during Nate Gamble's part of the presentation (before the Q & A session)

-They were the only team to use a stylus with their smartphone to demo their app prototype.

-Some team members could have been somewhat better-dressed for the occasion, with slightly more formal fashion sense.

-Positioning wise, they might have been blocking some people's view of the slides who sat on the side of the room facing the goldfish fountain,
on the far right.

-I don't expect everyone to sound as enthusiastic as Andrew Thomas, but there could have perhaps been more voice fluctuation (tonal changes) and
use of body language (gestures, etc.).

-Everyone seemed to maintain decent eye contact with the audience.

=================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================

Miscellaneous:

-Suggest including your supplemental technical requirements documentation in your CS-262-Materials repository alongside your other documents.
Right now, it is in your CS-262-Client repository and thus I had to go lookint for it in order to find it when I expected it in the other repository.
